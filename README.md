# EUTS2-MU
Welcome to EUTS2-MU (prononced as E-U-TS-2 MU) is a little project I made to rename music files based on their tag names. Made for the Euro Truck Simulator 2 radio, but not exclusively! 

To use download the EXE from the release.

Hello, here's a little wiki-ish thing explaining some stuff. (you can also access this in EUTS2-MU by typing in "extrahelp")
# TERMS
Here's some terms and what they mean.

replacelist

So, Windows has certain characters that can't be used in a file name,}and if I say for it to use say, a \ it will through a error and crash the code. So, we add a list including all the characters we can't have seperated by spaces (eg, / \\ < > ) And, other OSes might block different characters or you might want to use different characters, so you can use different lists!

replace
Well, what will you replace the \ with?
