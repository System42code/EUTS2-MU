# EUTS2-MU

Welcome to EUTS2-MU (pronounced as E-U-TS-2 MU) is a little project I made to rename music files based on their tag names. Made for the Euro Truck Simulator 2 radio, but not exclusively! 

To use it, download the EXE from the release.

# WIKI

Hello, here's a little wiki-ish thing explaining some stuff. (You can also access this in EUTS2-MU by typing in "extrahelp")

Here are some terms and what they mean.

## replacelist

So, Windows has certain characters that can't be used in a file name, and if I say for it to use a \ in the title, it will throw a error and crash the code. So, we add a list including all the characters we can't have separated by spaces (e.g., / \\ < > ) And other OSes might block different characters or you might want to use different characters, so you can use different lists!

## replace

Well, what will you replace the \ with?


# To-Do

## Features

Be able to do a custom name format, so instead of having it be Title - Artist no matter what, you can change it to be like

Artist - Title - Album - Artist if you want to.


## Bugs (not a feature)

Be able to use a path with spaces.

_yes, if you use a path with spaces like C:/music/MY MUSIC YIPEE! it will crash._

It currently iterates through a folder, so make a setting to turn it off.
